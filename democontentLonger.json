"58": "But of the fruit of the tree which <i>is</i> in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.",
"59": "And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:",
"60": "For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.",
"61": "And when the woman saw that the tree <i>was</i> good for food, and that it <i>was</i> pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make <i>one</i> wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.",
"62": "And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they <i>were</i> naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.",

"64": "And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where <i>art</i> thou?",
"65": "And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I <i>was</i> naked; and I hid myself.",
"66": "And he said, Who told thee that thou <i>wast</i> naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?",
"67": "And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest <i>to be</i> with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.",
"68": "And the LORD God said unto the woman, What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.",
"69": "And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou <i>art</i> cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:",
"70": "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.",
"71": "Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire <i>shall be</i> to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.",
"72": "And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed <i>is</i> the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat <i>of</i> it all the days of thy life;",
"73": "Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;",
"74": "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou <i>art</i>, and unto dust shalt thou return.",
"75": "And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.",
"76": "Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.",
"77": "And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:",
"78": "Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.",
"79": "So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.",
"80": "And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.",
"81": "And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.",
"82": "And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.",
"83": "And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:",
"84": "But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.",
"85": "And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?",
"86": "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee <i>shall be</i> his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.",
"87": "And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.",
"88": "And the LORD said unto Cain, Where <i>is</i> Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: <i>Am</i> I my brother’s keeper?",
"89": "And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.",
"90": "And now <i>art</i> thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;",
"91": "When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.",
"92": "And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment <i>is</i> greater than I can bear.",
"93": "Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> every one that findeth me shall slay me.",
"94": "And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.",
"95": "And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.",
"96": "And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.",
"97": "And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.",
"98": "And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one <i>was</i> Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.",
"99": "And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and <i>of such as have</i> cattle.",
"100": "And his brother’s name <i>was</i> Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.",
"101": "And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain <i>was</i> Naamah.",
"102": "And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.",
"103": "If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.",
"104": "And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, <i>said she</i>, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.",
"105": "And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.",
"106": "This <i>is</i> the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;",
"107": "Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.",
