still NN to think about what to say
NN to see if it looks nice.. changed the purechat theme color to #d5ad6d

NN to see... got rid of the "just a moment" thing so let's see if this solves the problem when we click on "verse" on a sample from the page

done	on click "continue to add YourName", NN to input focus in the name field
 
done	on click "review your order" NN to re-render textfill

done	on click "back to change verse" NN a setTimeout 1000ms hide in the selected_verse while is says undefined - undefined - undefined

create the white & black backgrounds and set white to default upon arrival
On arrival, NN to detect background situation & change font color & stroke accordingly
